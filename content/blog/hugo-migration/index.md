I don't know if this is better but it works just took a bit to migrate it.
I had lost all the posts and I was new to hugo.
There is supposed to be disqus support but I couldn't get it working.

I've changed my mind on the disqus thing.
More like accepted it.
A lot of blogs use it and implementing anything else on this theme right now would be too hard.
I'd rather be writing a post and not go almost three years with no post.

I'm using the beautiful hemingway2 theme which seems to be what I want.
Just need to add a link to an irc client but that's for later.

It suddenly got really cold here and I haven't been able to get out.
So instead I've been drawing and experimenting with new styles.
Looking back at my early drawings I am much better.
You can watch my progress on [deviantArt](https://rhg135.deviantart.com)
and [fur affinity](http://furaffinity.net/user/rhg135).
Lately I've posted to fa, but usually I post to dA so check both out!
Also be sure to follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/rhg135) as I usually post some sketches there.

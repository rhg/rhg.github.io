I wrote a story for NaPoWriMo. For those that don't know what it is [it's basically a self-imposed challange to write a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fanfiction](https://www.equestriadaily.com/2017/10/announcing-national-pony-writing-month.html). I didn't get to the 50k, but I did get to the 25k mark.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uji3xv_caonOR8PJAovA7zDmVv4c-M_j03hvUgD2WnE/edit?usp=sharing) it is. Eventually I will go over it and polish it up for editing. Right now it has a few major flaws.

description: Why am I moving to Gatsby?
---

I'm trying to move this blog over to [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)
because I actually know js unlike go and because I'm interested in [React](https://reactjs.org).

Having my site done in js helps in that I can add demo apps and custom content to my site
without having to wait for someone to do it or learning go. Plus React is rather unique
so I would have to code in js for that to happen.

I actually wanted to code up a simple game and post it on my site but I could never
figure out how to use custom content in hugo. I was going to code it in React anyway so
might as well use it for my blog.

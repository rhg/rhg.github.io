I really enjoy listening to music. There are several ways to get music.

* YT Music

  Honestly, I don't know much about this service. I did do the free trial and it
  seemed ok.

* Prime Music
  
  I used this for a while as I have *Prime* and did like it, but a lot of music
  moved to their unlimited plan and I didn't like that so I started to consider
  paying for a service. I especially liked the lyrics that scrolled.
  
* Play Music

  I did the free trial of this too and it was *ok*. Just ok. It worked and had
  good selection.
  
* iTunes Music
  
  I don't have an iPhone.
  
* Spotify
  
  This service was the winner. It's both social and musical. Social in that you
  can make public playlists that other users can see. As a bonus on the musical
  side they have their own studios and have exclusive music.
  
I really enjoy using spotify. The app is good; on desktop, Android, and
iOS. I do have three gripes for the app.

- Mobile app can't read local files thus can't be used as music app.

- No lyrics on most songs on mobile or any on desktop.

- Can't make a playlist from a station on Android.

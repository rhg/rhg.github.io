## So, I have a blog.

For a long time I pondered it, but never acted. Today a switch in my head finally flipped, and I became allowed to start writing; and more than that, setting up the infrastructure.

Fortunately—for me—my blog engine—[cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org)—was very easy to set-up and soon I was producing. Cryogen is distributed as a template for [leiningen](http://leiningen.org), and this made it easy to get started. For more details see the homepage for cryogen.
## What to expect

Plenty of mistakes—as I do not proofread my posts—and relatively short posts—being neither very interesting or public. A few surprises get forced in for good measure too.
## My only request—for now.

I need feedback. It's lonely over here, and I need guidance. I disabled disqus because ~~it is—unfortunately—prone to spam~~ I don't like it. As such I have a [Contact Me](../../pages/contact-me) link in the sidebar, and a embedded irc client under the posts on the site.

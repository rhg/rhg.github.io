      <description>I really enjoy listening to music. There are several ways to get music.
 YT Music  Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about this service. I did do the free trial and it seemed ok.
 Prime Music   I used this for a while as I have Prime and did like it, but a lot of music moved to their unlimited plan and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that so I started to consider paying for a service.</description>

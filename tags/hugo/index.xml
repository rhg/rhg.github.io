      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is better but it works just took a bit to migrate it. I had lost all the posts and I was new to hugo. There is supposed to be disqus support but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it working.
I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind on the disqus thing. More like accepted it. A lot of blogs use it and implementing anything else on this theme right now would be too hard.</description>

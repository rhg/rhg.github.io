      <description>So, I have a blog. For a long time I pondered it, but never acted. Today a switch in my head finally flipped, and I became allowed to start writing; and more than that, setting up the infrastructure.
Fortunately—for me—my blog engine—cryogen—was very easy to set-up and soon I was producing. Cryogen is distributed as a template for leiningen, and this made it easy to get started. For more details see the homepage for cryogen.</description>

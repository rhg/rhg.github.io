      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is better but it works just took a bit to migrate it. I had lost all the posts and I was new to hugo. There is supposed to be disqus support but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it working.
I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind on the disqus thing. More like accepted it. A lot of blogs use it and implementing anything else on this theme right now would be too hard.</description>

      <description>So, I have a blog. For a long time I pondered it, but never acted. Today a switch in my head finally flipped, and I became allowed to start writing; and more than that, setting up the infrastructure.
Fortunately—for me—my blog engine—cryogen—was very easy to set-up and soon I was producing. Cryogen is distributed as a template for leiningen, and this made it easy to get started. For more details see the homepage for cryogen.</description>

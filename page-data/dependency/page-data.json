Very bad.\nThe second is Abilify.\nSame deal.\nThe third is slightly more complex, Lyrica.\nWhen I take it I feel as I did years ago, but if I don’t then I get terrible nausea.\nA lot of people assume this is the same as addiction.\n<strong>It is not!</strong>\nDependency, to me, is when you <em>need</em> the drug.\nAddiction is when you <em>want</em> the drug.\nFurthermore it is possible to have both.\nFor example some alcoholics both crave alcohol and experience withdrawal.\nIt is also quite possible, and common when wanting to quit, to step down from addiction and dependance to just dependance.\nThat is when you realize you want to quit, but still need the drug.\nI’ve sort of experienced this with Lyrica when I tried to stop due to side-effects. I managed to cold-turkey, but then came the withdrawal so now I am back on.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dependency is Not Addiction","date":"January 28, 2018","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/dependency/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-to-pass/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What to Pass: a Var or IFn?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hugo-migration/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hugo Migration"}}}}}

Today a switch in my head finally flipped, and I became allowed to start writing; and more than that, setting up the infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Fortunately—for me—my blog engine—<a href=\"http://cryogenweb.org\">cryogen</a>—was very easy to set-up and soon I was producing. Cryogen is distributed as a template for <a href=\"http://leiningen.org\">leiningen</a>, and this made it easy to get started. For more details see the homepage for cryogen.</p>\n<h2>What to expect</h2>\n<p>Plenty of mistakes—as I do not proofread my posts—and relatively short posts—being neither very interesting or public. A few surprises get forced in for good measure too.</p>\n<h2>My only request—for now.</h2>\n<p>I need feedback. It’s lonely over here, and I need guidance. I disabled disqus because <del>it is—unfortunately—prone to spam</del> I don’t like it. As such I have a <a href=\"../../pages/contact-me\">Contact Me</a> link in the sidebar, and a embedded irc client under the posts on the site.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Look Ma!

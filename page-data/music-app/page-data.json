There are several ways to get music.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>YT Music</p>\n<p>Honestly, I don’t know much about this service. I did do the free trial and it\nseemed ok.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prime Music</p>\n<p>I used this for a while as I have <em>Prime</em> and did like it, but a lot of music\nmoved to their unlimited plan and I didn’t like that so I started to consider\npaying for a service. I especially liked the lyrics that scrolled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Play Music</p>\n<p>I did the free trial of this too and it was <em>ok</em>. Just ok. It worked and had\ngood selection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>iTunes Music</p>\n<p>I don’t have an iPhone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spotify</p>\n<p>This service was the winner. It’s both social and musical. Social in that you\ncan make public playlists that other users can see. As a bonus on the musical\nside they have their own studios and have exclusive music.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I really enjoy using spotify. The app is good; on desktop, Android, and\niOS. I do have three gripes for the app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile app can’t read local files thus can’t be used as music app.</li>\n<li>No lyrics on most songs on mobile or any on desktop.</li>\n<li>Can’t make a playlist from a station on Android.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Music App","date":"February 02, 2018","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/music-app/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/cycling-is-fun/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cycling Is Fun"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/I-am-getting-better-at-drawing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"I Am Getting Better at Drawing"}}}}}

      <description>I live more on Twitter these days. I am a man of few words so having a blog is hard for me sometimes. I try to write at least one tweet per day and if I ever need more space I&amp;rsquo;ll tweet a link to my blog.</description>

      <description>It suddenly got really cold here and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get out. So instead I&amp;rsquo;ve been drawing and experimenting with new styles. Looking back at my early drawings I am much better. You can watch my progress on deviantArt and fur affinity. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve posted to fa, but usually I post to dA so check both out! Also be sure to follow my twitter as I usually post some sketches there.</description>

      <description>I really enjoy listening to music. There are several ways to get music.
 YT Music  Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about this service. I did do the free trial and it seemed ok.
 Prime Music   I used this for a while as I have Prime and did like it, but a lot of music moved to their unlimited plan and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that so I started to consider paying for a service.</description>

      <description>Cycling is fun. Even though I am so out of practice and I can&amp;rsquo;t use a bicycle that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop me. I bought myself a tricycle and recently have started using it again. I used to, but stopped due to crippling depression and anxiety. </description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what to write today. I&amp;rsquo;m not very interesting, but why should I just not write today. Instead, I will write these posts about not knowing what to write and randomness.
I&amp;rsquo;m not very versed at speaking from my self rather I prefer a prompt or question; which, of course, on a blog I don&amp;rsquo;t have. I will try my best though. So let&amp;rsquo;s just review the past few months.</description>

      <title>NaPoWriMo Entry</title>

      <description>I wrote a story for NaPoWriMo. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is it&amp;rsquo;s basically a self-imposed challange to write a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fanfiction. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to the 50k, but I did get to the 25k mark.
Here it is. Eventually I will go over it and polish it up for editing. Right now it has a few major flaws.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is better but it works just took a bit to migrate it. I had lost all the posts and I was new to hugo. There is supposed to be disqus support but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it working.
I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind on the disqus thing. More like accepted it. A lot of blogs use it and implementing anything else on this theme right now would be too hard.</description>

      <title>Dependency is Not Addiction</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it; I am dependant on three drugs, but I am not an addict. The first of these is clear-cut, fluoxetine. I take it, good, I don&amp;rsquo;t, bad. Very bad. The second is Abilify. Same deal. The third is slightly more complex, Lyrica. When I take it I feel as I did years ago, but if I don&amp;rsquo;t then I get terrible nausea. A lot of people assume this is the same as addiction.</description>

      <title>What to Pass: a Var or IFn?</title>

      <description>Mapping a function over a channel You have a function you are developing:
(defn name-string &amp;quot;Gives you the name string from a suitable map&amp;quot; [{:keys [first-name]}] first-name)  and you want to run this on maps you get over, say, a socket. Thus you shove it up a channel with an attached transducer of (map name-string) (or with a pipeline of the actual data channel, for the indirection).
A Problem Arises Now, you want to incorporate the last name as an initial.</description>

      <title>On Licensing</title>
      <link>https://rhg135.com/posts/on-licensing/</link>

      <description>What about it? Copyright is broken. The whole concept of controlling copying of a resource is just not viable, and furthermore erronous. To me it is reminiscent of censorship, and we all know how well that works.
Lately I have been releasing any works to the public domain. Before discussing why, let&amp;rsquo;s examine this &amp;ldquo;copyright&amp;rdquo; thing.
What got me thinking about this I don&amp;rsquo;t recall what exactly was being looked for when I saw a project on github with an UNLICENSE file.</description>

      <title>Look Ma! I Made Post!</title>

      <description>So, I have a blog. For a long time I pondered it, but never acted. Today a switch in my head finally flipped, and I became allowed to start writing; and more than that, setting up the infrastructure.
Fortunately—for me—my blog engine—cryogen—was very easy to set-up and soon I was producing. Cryogen is distributed as a template for leiningen, and this made it easy to get started. For more details see the homepage for cryogen.</description>

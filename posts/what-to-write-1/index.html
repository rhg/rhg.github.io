<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what to write today. I&rsquo;m not very interesting, but why should I just not write today.
Instead, I will write these posts about not knowing what to write and randomness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not very versed at speaking from my self rather I prefer a prompt or question;
which, of course, on a blog I don&rsquo;t have. I will try my best though.
So let&rsquo;s just review the past few months.</p>

<h2 id="october">October</h2>

<p>This was a good month for me. At the start of the month, on the 5th, I went to see <em>My Little Pony: The Movie</em> in a local theater, where the room was packed with fans, saw a great film, and had the strongest drink I&rsquo;d had till then.
Then at the end of the month, 27-29, I went to the <em>Nightmare Nights</em> convention, a <em>Friendship is Magic</em> fan convention. It was fun, saw a lot of cool things, but didn&rsquo;t talk much to people.</p>

<h2 id="november">November</h2>

<p>This month was a lot more laid back. Our Thanksgiving was low-key and we just played <em>Monopoly</em> at home. Then the next day we went with family.
After all this we returned to the normal routine. At the very end of the month I had to choose whether to accompany my mom on an emergency visit, and left and got to see the beach for real finally.
The plane ride ane subsequent car, wer so long and added to my lack of sleep made it so that when I arrived I was so tired.</p>
